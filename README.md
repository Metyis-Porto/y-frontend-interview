# METYIS - Interview Project

### Project - Random Facts Timeline

Build a SPA that follows these requirements: 
 * Ability to generate random facts. You can use this endpoint from NumbersAPI: http://numbersapi.com/random/year?json
 * Display the facts in a timeline by year
 * Show more info about a year‚Äôs fact by clicking on that year in the timeline.
 * Ability to remove uninteresting facts.
 
### How is this project organized?
This project uses Create-React-App in its initial state. If the interviewee pretends to start the project in another React environment other than CRA is free to do so.

### Main goals
The main goal of this project is for us to assess your skills, your logic-thinking as well as your level of comfort with different web technologies. 

You can use any library available (i.e. state management libraries). Choice and usage of libraries will also weigh in the evaluation.
 
### Design Idea

You can choose to implement the design given or change it to something more of your liking. Attention to detail and usability concerns are appreciated.
